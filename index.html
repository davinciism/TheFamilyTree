        <p>Family Tree is a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team set up in 2018 to address the gap in such services in New Delhi. It is composed of Child and Adolescent Psychotherapists who work to support children, adolescents and families with emotional and relationship difficulties.
            <br><br>
        It is a self-funded team based out of Safdurjung Enclave and we have seen over 150 children and adolescents in the last two years. All of our referrals are by word-of-mouth.</p>

        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Chances are that you have found your way here after speaking to someone you already know. This is important, because it suggests that you have started the process of ‘doing something different’ and sharing a bit of what is important to you. <br><br>
        Conversations at Family Tree tend to be about stuff that is central to us all: Feelings – whether consciously known or leaking out in some way, and Relationships – past and present.
        <br><br>
        The conversations are also about ordinary, everyday events, behaviour and difficulties, which are part of everyone’s lives but can also cause distress – big or small. If it matters to you, it is worth talking about.</p>

        <p>Addressing emotional matters takes courage and can take time. You may need to see us regularly for some weeks/months. During this time, there will be moments when you want to avoid the emotional hard work and therefore avoid us. Frequently, this happens by ‘forgetting’ an appointment or not feeling like coming. 
            <br><br>
        We make it easy for you to remember your next appointment with us by trying to keep it at the same time and day every week. However, it is your responsibility to keep the appointment, since it is part of you taking care of yourself. Sessions at Family Tree are one hour long, unless otherwise discussed.</p>

            <h1>Love and Rage</h1>
            <p>
                Love & Rage is a book about children, both the child in those of us who are chronologically adult, as well as the children we may be interacting with. It takes a reader for a journey into their inner world of intense, raging emotions which often goes unheeded by the outside adult world. With the trained ear of a child psychotherapist, the author listens to children’s stories as they emerge in her consulting room, through word and play, and translates them for adults.
                <br>
                Supported by the author’s own personal associations and a bedrock of psychodynamic theory, the book throws light on what comes into a psychotherapist’s consulting room, and demonstrates that it is not unusual, bizarre or crazy. Instead, it is the ordinary stuff of everyday life, taking place in every family. That sometimes we all carry the pain of complex feelings within ourselves for all of our lives—love and rage towards the people we are closest to.
                <br>
                This book is essential reading for anyone close to children—parents and parents-to-be, teachers, school counsellors—but also for anyone looking to attend to the child within them.

                    <br>
                She started Family Tree: Child and Adolescent Mental Health team, in 2018 in New Delhi. She taught ‘Infant Observation’ on the Psychotherapy training course at Ambedkar University, Delhi from 2012-2020. She is regularly invited to write articles on emotional and mental health for national dailies and for discussions on conference panels. You can find a lot of this through a google search.
                    <br>    
                In 2014 she decided to train further, especially on how to work with hard-to-engage-adolescents, anxiety and depression in young people. She completed a certification in Intensive Short Term Dynamic Psychotherapy. The process of this training took five years of consistent truth-facing and changed her life, making her more courageous. Now she is training others to work with this technique. She is the author of Love & Rage: The Inner Worlds of Children, which was published in 2017, which is very close to her heart and has a lot of detail on what psychotherapy with children looks like. Along with her husband, Richard Paiva, she is a co-founder of The Art of Sport – a development programme for girls, using sport and group therapy.

                For her own energy and emotional balance, she likes to dance and though her motor coordination does not approve, she does not let that stop her.</p>
