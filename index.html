        <p>Chances are that you have found your way here after speaking to someone you already know. This is important, because it suggests that you have started the process of ‘doing something different’ and sharing a bit of what is important to you. <br><br>
        Conversations at Family Tree tend to be about stuff that is central to us all: Feelings – whether consciously known or leaking out in some way, and Relationships – past and present.
        <br><br>
        The conversations are also about ordinary, everyday events, behaviour and difficulties, which are part of everyone’s lives but can also cause distress – big or small. If it matters to you, it is worth talking about.</p>

        <p>Family Tree is a Mental Health Team set up in 2018 to address the gap in such services in New Delhi. It is composed of Child and Adolescent Psychotherapists who work to support children, adolescents and families with emotional and relationship difficulties.
            <br><br>
        It is a self-funded team based out of Safdurjung Enclave and we have seen over 500 children and adolescents in the last 5 years. All of our referrals are by word-of-mouth.</p>

        <p>Addressing emotional matters takes courage and can take time. You may need to see us regularly for some weeks/months. During this time, there will be moments when you want to avoid the emotional hard work and therefore avoid us. Frequently, this happens by ‘forgetting’ an appointment or not feeling like coming. 
            <br><br>
        We make it easy for you to remember your next appointment with us by trying to keep it at the same time and day every week. However, it is your responsibility to keep the appointment, since it is part of you taking care of yourself. Sessions at Family Tree are one hour long, unless otherwise discussed.</p>

                    <br>
                She started Family Tree: Child and Adolescent Mental Health team, in 2018 in New Delhi. She taught ‘Infant Observation’ on the Psychotherapy training course at Ambedkar University, Delhi from 2012-2020. She is regularly invited to write articles on emotional and mental health for national dailies and for discussions on conference panels. You can find a lot of this through a google search.
                    <br>    
                In 2014 she decided to train further, especially on how to work with hard-to-engage-adolescents, anxiety and depression in young people. She completed a certification in Intensive Short Term Dynamic Psychotherapy. The process of this training took five years of consistent truth-facing and changed her life, making her more courageous. Now she is training others to work with this technique. She is the author of Love & Rage: The Inner Worlds of Children, which was published in 2017, which is very close to her heart and has a lot of detail on what psychotherapy with children looks like. Along with her husband, Richard Paiva, she is a co-founder of The Art of Sport – a development programme for girls, using sport and group therapy.
                    <br>     
                For her own energy and emotional balance, she likes to dance and though her motor coordination does not approve, she does not let that stop her.</p>

                    More than the fact that she is psychoanalytically trained at PTRC (Psychoanalytic Training and Research Centre), Mumbai, it is her natural empathy toward the emotional world of young humans that makes her an effective child psychotherapist.

                    She has worked with children and young adults for over 7 years in a variety of settings. She has also worked with children with special developmental needs.

                    She has worked in places few dare to tread - mental health centres in university settings. She has borne the red-tape, the senior administration who don’t understand the emotional issues of young people, the high rates of self harm and suicidal thoughts in her clients.
                    <br>
                    At Family Tree we are grateful to Ambika for her experience and commitment to working on the darkest of real subjects - understanding ‘suicidality’ and its representations in the Indian context.

                    She is occasionally frightened of working with small kids though - and we are helping her get over that .

                    Shweta has also been trained at Antarnaad foundation, Ahmadabad for a year and is a RCI certified Rehabilitation Psychologist, all of which makes her a highly prized clinician.
                    <br>
                    Shweta finds it very easy to connect with children and happily joins in the fitness group activities while she facilitates a group at @artofsportindia which she is missing terribly during the lockdown even though it is now online.
                    <br>
                    Recently she has also been working towards building a vocabulary for doing psychoanalysis in Hindi - an attempt to take psychoanalysis beyond the clinic and the elite, thereby making it more accessible.

                    Much like the children she works with through play and stories, Shweta enjoys craft activities-making things out of waste material and scrap. What we appreciate the most though is what she makes out of the distress, anxiety and silence that she works with in her young clients.</p>

            <h1>Love and Rage</h1>
            <p>
                Love & Rage is a book about children, both the child in those of us who are chronologically adult, as well as the children we may be interacting with. It takes a reader for a journey into their inner world of intense, raging emotions which often goes unheeded by the outside adult world. With the trained ear of a child psychotherapist, the author listens to children’s stories as they emerge in her consulting room, through word and play, and translates them for adults.
                <br><br>
                Supported by the author’s own personal associations and a bedrock of psychodynamic theory, the book throws light on what comes into a psychotherapist’s consulting room, and demonstrates that it is not unusual, bizarre or crazy. Instead, it is the ordinary stuff of everyday life, taking place in every family. That sometimes we all carry the pain of complex feelings within ourselves for all of our lives—love and rage towards the people we are closest to.
                <br><br>
                This book is essential reading for anyone close to children—parents and parents-to-be, teachers, school counsellors—but also for anyone looking to attend to the child within them.

            <h1>Interruptions in Identity: Engaging with Suicidality among the Indian Youth</h1>
            <p>
                Interruptions in Identity: Engaging with Suicidality among the Indian Youth explores the shift in the author’s perspective from an understanding of ‘suicide’ to an exploration of suicidality. The shift came organically from her experience of working in a university clinic and interacting with individuals who had communicated to her the presence of ‘suicidal thoughts’ during their sessions. The work is also an examination of how studying a tendency towards committing suicide is necessarily an attempt to understand the complex interplay of the personal and the social which often leads to that tendency described as suicidality. The work turns a psychosocial lens and further elaborates on how suicidality expresses itself in the space between the subject and the therapist within the safe space of a clinic. In taking us through these narratives, the author builds a case that it is important to reflect not just on the nature of individual suffering but also its interaction with the prevalent and relevant socio-political forces
