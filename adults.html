        <p>Chances are that you have found your way here after speaking to someone you already know. This is important, because it suggests that you have started the process of ‘doing something different’ and sharing a bit of what is important to you. <br><br>
        Conversations at Family Tree tend to be about stuff that is central to us all: Feelings – whether consciously known or leaking out in some way, and Relationships – past and present.
        <br><br>
        The conversations are also about ordinary, everyday events, behaviour and difficulties, which are part of everyone’s lives but can also cause distress – big or small. If it matters to you, it is worth talking about.</p>

        <p>Family Tree is a Mental Health Team set up in 2018 to address the gap in such services in New Delhi. It is composed of Child and Adolescent Psychotherapists who work to support children, adolescents and families with emotional and relationship difficulties.
            <br><br>
        It is a self-funded team based out of Safdurjung Enclave and we have seen over 500 children and adolescents in the last 5 years. All of our referrals are by word-of-mouth.</p>

        <p>Addressing emotional matters takes courage and can take time. You may need to see us regularly for some weeks/months. During this time, there will be moments when you want to avoid the emotional hard work and therefore avoid us. Frequently, this happens by ‘forgetting’ an appointment or not feeling like coming. 
            <br><br>
        We make it easy for you to remember your next appointment with us by trying to keep it at the same time and day every week. However, it is your responsibility to keep the appointment, since it is part of you taking care of yourself. Sessions at Family Tree are one hour long, unless otherwise discussed.</p>

        <h1>Book an Appointment</h1>

            <p>Our charges are INR 3500 an hour. If this is difficult for you to afford, please bring it up with your psychotherapist. When we book an appointment with you, we keep that hour aside for you. If you cannot make it for some reason, please let us know at least 48 hours in advance so we can offer the time to someone who is waiting for an appointment.</p>
            <p>We charge for missed appointments and cancellations under 48 hrs. We understand that what you are doing takes courage. We work hard to keep your personal story confidential and do our best to make you feel safe.</p>
